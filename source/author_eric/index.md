## Where I Come From?
I'm come from China, with my friend and myself, I create the BROKEN UNIVERSE. China always beautiful, welcome to China!

## Why I Create BROKEN UNIVERSER?
When I realize that I have so much idea in my mind, I think I should write down and share to my friend. In 2023, My first BROKEN version is release. At first, It called "XIKONG" and it's the first UNIVERSE version that I create. 

Turns out, I created so much active roles, my friend said that could be more great when I did more. So, I wrote the second story "Wandering Nothingness", and this is the first time I wrote a novel.

Then, I spend so much time to write down my idea, what I think right now. So, The BROKEN UNIVERSE is release. It's the second version, we don't use "XIKONG", but we still have some same "XIKONG" content in BROKEN UNIVERSE.
